The code in this directory is a test implementation of the ADC code in the parent directory applied to the ADS7883 IC. 
This code was used to help develop the PRU version in the Chapter13 directory.

This code is functional, but it suffers from jitter (as expected) and as such the data rate cannot be set higher than 
the MCP3008, despite being a 12-bit 2MSps capable device. Note: this device does not require a MOSI as the data is 
sampled on the falling edge of chip select (CS).

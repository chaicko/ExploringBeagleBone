High-Speed Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC) using the PRU-ICSS

Written by Derek Molloy to support the book Exploring BeagleBone

Please see http://www.exploringbeaglebone.com/chapter13/ for a full description of the code in this directory.

There are two versions of the PRUADC.p:
- One that captures up to 500kSps, the variable rate version
- One that captures only 1MSps, the fixed rate version

Copy the one that you require to the PRUADC.p and type build. While the ADS7883 is capable of 2MSps
it will be very difficult to modify the code to support this rate as the data transfer clock is very
close to its maximum rate at 1MSps.
